# app_music

I implemented a Google codelab, an audio controller that plays sounds, loops music, and applies effects.

## Key Concepts Learnt

- How to play one-shot sounds.
- How to play and customize gapless music loops.
- How to fade sounds in and out.
- How to apply environmental effects to sounds.
- How to deal with exceptions.
- How to encapsulate all of these features into a single audio controller.
